# Welcome to *Mana Abyss*

A strategy-driven simulation game where the balance of mana shapes your world. Beneath your humble village lie sprawling dungeons rich in mana, a mysterious energy that fuels life and power. However, the mana's strength is concentrated deep below the surface, where only the bravest can venture.

In *Mana Abyss*, your mission is to grow and develop your village while unlocking and conquering the dangerous depths of elemental dungeons. Each dungeon possesses its own unique elemental composition—be it a fiery mix of Pyro and Hydro, or an icy domain of pure Cryo. As you explore deeper levels, the mana becomes more potent, but so do the creatures that guard it.

## Game Features

- **Village and Dungeon Building**: Develop your village by constructing mana collectors, elemental mines, and specialized farms that extract and refine resources based on the dungeon's elemental properties. Build and manage production chains for resources like manastones, mana crystals, mana herbs, and more.
- **Dynamic Dungeons**: Clear dungeon floors and harness their mana to expand your influence. Each floor you clear can host new facilities such as mana silk farms, item factories, or resource storage units. The deeper you go, the more valuable resources you'll discover—but only if you’ve researched and upgraded your village and dungeon floors.
- **Elemental Strategy**: Each dungeon has a distinct elemental property, affecting the types of resources and monsters you encounter. Tailor your strategy to maximize elemental mana extraction and prepare your soldiers to exploit enemy weaknesses.
- **Conquer and Upgrade**: Assemble, upgrade, and merge soldiers, equipment, and consumables to take on the most dangerous dungeon floors. As you progress, unlock new dungeon slots, increase your village level, and configure elemental properties to suit your needs.

## The Abyss Awaits

Will you gather enough mana to ascend as the ultimate conqueror of the abyss? Every decision you make will shape the fate of your village and its soldiers as you face the challenges hidden deep beneath the surface.
